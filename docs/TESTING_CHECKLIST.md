## Context Reduction Validation

### Output Quality Checks
For each tool, verify:
- [ ] **90%+ reduction** in output size compared to raw Docker commands
- [ ] **100% preservation** of errors and warnings
- [ ] **Key information retained**: service status, ports, health, errors
- [ ] **Noise filtered out**: layer downloads, cache operations, verbose progress

### Specific Filtering Tests
- [ ] `compose up` filters pull progress but keeps service status
- [ ] `compose build` filters layer operations but keeps build errors  
- [ ] `compose logs` filters timestamps but keeps error levels
- [ ] `compose migrate` filters connection info but keeps migration status
- [ ] `compose ps` formats output for readability

## Integration Quality Checks

### Claude Interaction Quality
- [ ] Commands understood in natural language
- [ ] Responses are conversational and helpful
- [ ] Follow-up questions handled appropriately
- [ ] Context maintained across multiple commands

### User Experience Validation
- [ ] No need to learn Docker Compose syntax
- [ ] Clear feedback on operation progress
- [ ] Helpful error messages and suggestions
- [ ] Intuitive command interpretation

## Final Validation

   - "Start my development environment"
   - "Run all tests"
   - "Start watching for changes"  
   - "Create a database backup"
   - "Show me performance metrics"
   - "Stop everything cleanly"

### Documentation Verification
