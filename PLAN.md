# Docker Compose MCP Server - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Building an MCP server that wraps Docker Compose operations with intelligent output filtering, reducing context usage by 90%+ while maintaining complete operational visibility. Inspired by xcode-build-mcp's approach to managing complex build tools.

## Key Insights from xcode-build-mcp

### Successful Patterns Observed
1. **Structured Tool Organization**: Clear separation between build, test, run, and utility operations
2. **Session Management**: Long-running operations (logs, monitoring) use session IDs
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple tools for common tasks, advanced tools for complex workflows
4. **Output Intelligence**: Smart filtering that preserves errors and critical information
5. **Workflow Support**: Tools that chain together naturally (build â†’ test â†’ deploy)
6. **Discovery Tools**: Help users understand what's available (list projects, devices, etc.)

### Mapping to Docker Compose
