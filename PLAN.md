# Docker Compose MCP Server - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Building an MCP server that wraps Docker Compose operations with intelligent output filtering, reducing context usage by 90%+ while maintaining complete operational visibility. Inspired by xcode-build-mcp's approach to managing complex build tools.

## Key Insights from xcode-build-mcp

### Successful Patterns Observed
1. **Structured Tool Organization**: Clear separation between build, test, run, and utility operations
2. **Session Management**: Long-running operations (logs, monitoring) use session IDs
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple tools for common tasks, advanced tools for complex workflows
4. **Output Intelligence**: Smart filtering that preserves errors and critical information
5. **Workflow Support**: Tools that chain together naturally (build → test → deploy)
6. **Discovery Tools**: Help users understand what's available (list projects, devices, etc.)

### Mapping to Docker Compose

| xcode-build-mcp | docker-compose-mcp Equivalent | Purpose |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| build_*_proj/ws | docker_compose_build | Build services with filtered output |
| test_*_proj/ws | docker_compose_test | Run tests with smart result filtering |
| launch_app_* | docker_compose_up | Start services with health monitoring |
| stop_app_* | docker_compose_down | Stop services cleanly |
| get_*_logs | docker_compose_logs | Filtered log retrieval |
| list_devices | docker_compose_ps | List running containers |
| install_app_* | docker_compose_deploy | Deploy/update services |
| diagnostic | docker_compose_health | Health check and diagnostics |
